## Security Considerations

- Role-based permissions for group management
- Private groups for sensitive discussions
- Audit trail through message timestamps and sender tracking

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time message delivery with WebSocket integration
- Push notifications for urgent messages
- File and image sharing capabilities
- Message search and archival
- Integration with patient records (with proper HIPAA compliance)
- Voice message support
- Message encryption for sensitive communications

## Integration Points
- **Employee Management**: Uses existing employee data and access controls
- **Navigation**: Integrated into main admin sidebar
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing application design system
- **Responsive Layout**: Works with existing sidebar collapse functionality

This messaging system provides a solid foundation for hospital staff communication while maintaining security, usability, and medical workflow integration.
